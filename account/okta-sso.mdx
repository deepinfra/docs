DeepInfra supports Okta-based Single Sign-On (SSO) via OpenID Connect for teams that need centralized identity management.

## Supported features

- SSO initiated via Okta (IdP-initiated)
- SSO initiated via DeepInfra (SP-initiated)
- Automatic account creation on first sign-in

## Configuration steps

1. **Install the DeepInfra app** in your Okta instance
2. **Fill in the configuration**:
   - **Team ID** — your Okta subdomain is a good starting point. For multi-tenancy (multiple teams in one Okta instance), use `subdomain-group`. Lowercase only, starting with subdomain, dashes for separators.
   - **Use Stage** — leave blank
3. **Assign users or groups** who should have access to DeepInfra
4. In the DeepInfra App (inside Okta), go to the **Sign On** tab and note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. For the **Issuer** (your Okta domain): find the link titled *OpenID Provider Metadata*, click it, and copy the `"issuer"` URL from the JSON document
6. **Email feedback@deepinfra.com** with:
   - Team ID
   - Issuer
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Admin email (the user who will be team admin)

After setup is complete, users can sign in via:
- Okta dashboard
- DeepInfra's [SSO login page](https://deepinfra.com/login_sso) (enter your Team ID)

## SP-initiated SSO

1. Go to [deepinfra.com/login](https://deepinfra.com/login)
2. Click **Corporate SSO**
3. Enter your **Team ID** and click **SSO Login**
4. Enter your Okta credentials and click **Sign in with Okta**
5. You're redirected to the DeepInfra dashboard

## Team management notes

- Admin can change team member roles (member / admin)
- Admin has access to the billing dashboard
- All team members share the same API tokens and models
- For per-user isolation (separate tokens and models per person), contact us
