DeepInfra hosts text-to-video models that generate short video clips from a text description. Browse [all text-to-video models](https://deepinfra.com/models/text-to-video).

## Endpoint

```
POST https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/inference/{model_name}
```

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests

DEEPINFRA_TOKEN = "$DEEPINFRA_TOKEN"
MODEL = "Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B"

response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/inference/{MODEL}",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {DEEPINFRA_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "prompt": "A serene mountain lake at sunrise, with mist rising from the water and pine trees reflected on the surface.",
    },
)

result = response.json()
# result["video"] contains the URL to the generated video
print(result["video"])
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "A serene mountain lake at sunrise, with mist rising from the water and pine trees reflected on the surface."}' \
  'https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/inference/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-14B'
```

## Tips for good prompts

- Be descriptive about the scene, lighting, and motion
- Specify the camera movement if relevant (e.g. "slow pan", "aerial shot", "close-up")
- Keep prompts focused — overly complex prompts can produce inconsistent results
- Use the [negative prompt](https://deepinfra.com/models/text-to-video) parameter (if supported) to exclude unwanted elements

## Async inference

Video generation is compute-intensive and may take longer than text inference. Consider using [webhooks](/account/webhooks) to receive the result asynchronously rather than polling.
