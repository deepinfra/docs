Due to the fast paced AI world, newer and better models are being released everyday.
At the same time DeepInfra wants to ensure afforadble and high quality access
to the latest and best AI models.

As a result sometimes we have to make the difficult decision to deprecate a model.

However, whenever this happens, you are going to have enough time to select
another [one of our models](/models) that best fits your needs.

First, you are going to know at least a week in advance when a model is going to be deprecated.

Second, even after the deprecation date the API will continue to operate and your applications
will continue to work. All inference requests will automatically be forwarded to another model.

In addition, when a model is deprecated we are going to send an email to notify all recent users, including
a date when it will happen.
