GPU Instances provide on-demand access to high-performance GPU compute in the cloud. You get a dedicated container with SSH access and full control over your environment.

## Key features

- **Dedicated GPU access** — no sharing with other users
- **SSH access** — connect directly to your container
- **Flexible GPU configs** — B200, H200, H100, A100, and more
- **Pay-per-use** — billed by the hour, only while running
- **Quick setup** — running in minutes

## Use cases

- LLM training and fine-tuning
- GPU-accelerated inference workloads
- Data processing and analysis
- Development and testing of GPU applications
- Research and experimentation

## Web UI

### Start a new container

1. Go to [Dashboard → Instances](https://deepinfra.com/dash/instances)
2. Click **New Container**
3. **Select GPU configuration** — choose from available GPU types. Each shows:
   - GPU type, quantity, and memory (e.g., `1xB200-180GB`, `8xH200-141GB`)
   - Hourly pricing
   - Availability status
4. **Enter container details**:
   - **Container Name** — a descriptive name
   - **SSH Key** — paste your public SSH key (format: `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E...`)
5. Accept the NVIDIA license agreements and cryptocurrency mining policy
6. Click **I agree to the above**

### Connect to a running container

1. Wait for container status to show `running`
2. Click on the SSH login field to copy the command
3. Run `ssh ubuntu@<ip-address>` in your terminal

### Stop a container

1. Click on the container in the instances list
2. Click **Terminate**
3. Type `confirm` and click **Terminate**

<Warning>
  All container data is permanently lost when terminated. Save your work before stopping.
</Warning>

## HTTP API

### Create a container

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/containers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "my-container",
    "gpu_config": "8xB200-180GB",
    "container_image": "di-cont-ubuntu-torch:latest",
    "cloud_init_user_data": "#cloud-config\nusers:\n- name: ubuntu\n  shell: /bin/bash\n  sudo: '\''ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL'\''\n  ssh_authorized_keys:\n  - ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2E..."
  }'
```

### Get container details

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/containers/{container_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN"
```

Once `running`, connect via SSH:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@<container-ip>
```

### List containers

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/containers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN"
```

### Terminate a container

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/containers/{container_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN"
```

## Container lifecycle
