---

Deploy LoRA adapters for image generation on top of supported base image models. Source your LoRA from [Civitai](https://civitai.com).

## Prerequisites

1. A public LoRA model from Civitai
2. A DeepInfra account

## Deploy an image LoRA

1. Go to [Dashboard](https://deepinfra.com/dash)
2. Click **New Deployment**
3. Click the **LoRA text to image** tab
4. Fill in the form:
   - **LoRA model name** — name used to reference this deployment
   - **Base Model** — select the base model for this LoRA
   - **Civitai URL** — URL of the LoRA model from civitai.com

The deployment appears in [Dashboard → Deployments](https://deepinfra.com/dash/deployments) with state `Initializing`. Deployment time varies from 5 seconds to 1 minute depending on LoRA size. Once `Running`, the model is ready to use.

## Inference

### Direct API endpoint

```bash
curl "https://api.deepinfra.com/yourname/yourmodel" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
      "prompt": "A cat in anime style",
      "lora_scale": 0.7
    }'
```

### OpenAI-compatible endpoint

```bash
curl "https://api.deepinfra.com/v1/openai/images/generations" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $DEEPINFRA_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
      "model": "yourname/yourmodel",
      "prompt": "A cat in anime style"
    }'
```

## Notes

- Only public Civitai models are supported
- Base models support the same parameters as their original versions
- `lora_scale` controls the strength of the LoRA adaptation (0.0–1.0)
